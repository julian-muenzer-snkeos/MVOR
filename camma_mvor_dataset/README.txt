DATASET DESCRIPTION
================================================
The MVOR dataset consists of 732 synchronized multi-view frames recorded by three RGB-D cameras in a hybrid OR. Each multi-view frame consists of three color and three depth images.
The MVOR dataset was sampled from four days of recording in an interventional room at the University Hospital of Strasbourg during procedures such as vertebroplasty and lung biopsy.
The ground truth bounding boxes, 2D keypoint annotations, 3D keypoint annotations, and visualisation and evaluation scripts are available at http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/datasets
